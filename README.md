# Piquante

This is the front end and back end server for Project 6 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation

use `npm i dotenv `to setup `process.env.TOKEN` for the jsonWebToken, `process.env.PSEUDO` & `process.env.PASSWORD` for the mangoose.connect access.

Clone this repo. From the "backend" folder of the project, run `npm install` and `npm install -g nodemon`. You
can then run the server with `nodemon server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Front end Installation

Clone this repo. From the "frontend" folder of the project, run `npm install` and `npm run start`.

after a little while you can nom access the interface by that url `http://localhost:4200`
